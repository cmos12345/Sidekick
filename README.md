A Path of Exile helper that shows item prices using the **official** [Path of Exile Trade API](https://www.pathofexile.com/trade) instead of [poe.trade](http://poe.trade).

## Description

If you used [POE-TradeMacro](https://github.com/PoE-TradeMacro/POE-TradeMacro), it's the same idea.

Sidekick should be able to price check almost every item, the idea is to eventually be able to modify your search on-the-fly and configure which attributes are selected by default depending on the item type.

**Enjoy!**

## Warning
This is a **BETA**, it will probably break in some cases, if it does, don't hesitate to [create an issue](https://github.com/domialex/Sidekick/issues).

**[Remember to choose your league with the league selector](https://i.imgur.com/7uFb7NF.png).**
