# Sidekick 0.5.0-beta
A Path of Exile helper that shows item prices using the official Path of Exile Trade API.

## Description
If you used [POE-TradeMacro](https://github.com/PoE-TradeMacro/POE-TradeMacro), it's the same idea.

Sidekick should be able to price check almost every item, the idea is to eventually be able to modify your search on-the-fly and configure which attributes are selected by default depending on the item type.

## Missing from this version
Unfortunetly, one of the most asked for feature was not ready in time. The advanced search and item filters were not ready. Development is under way, but there is still a lot of issues and work to be done before we release it.

As soon as it is ready, we will make a new release, it shouldn't be long.

## Beta?
Yes, this is still a beta since some core features are missing. We are thinking of removing the beta label once the advanced search / item filters are completed.

## Warning
This is a **BETA**, it will probably break in some cases, if it does, don't hesitate to [create an issue](https://github.com/domialex/Sidekick/issues).

## Installation
1. Download Sidekick.exe file
2. Run Sidekick.exe.

## Usage

3. Put **Path of Exile** in **Windowed** or **Windowed Fullscreen** mode for best results.
4. In **Path of Exile**, hover an item and press **Ctrl+D** (default binding).
5. To close the overlay, press **Space** (default binding).
